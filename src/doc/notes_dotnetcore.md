# Notes 

## Main research questions

Bootstrapping the .NET execution engine is the start, and this is what most of the information out there details. Fine. But in the end it is a small part of rclr, and documentation is very patchy or unclear as to: 

* How much of the prior, .NET Framework MSCorEE API objects and methods remains valid or conversely superseded by .NET core
* How much of the prior, .NET Framework MSCorEE API objects and methods remains windows only
* Would the Mono part of the native codebase be completely obsolete and if so, has as much to be rewritten for .NET core 


More "drastic" or left field approaches:

* Feasibility to completely reengineer with more code in C# than C++ (in the spirit of Python for .NET) - but has this already been pushed as much as possible?
* Is there an opportunity to engineer some subsystems and share with projects such as Python for .NET

* Desirable things "on the edge"
    * Using Rcpp for glue code - definitely wanted technically, but what does that mean for licensing; are there subtleties different from R itself in terms of rClr users
